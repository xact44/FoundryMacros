# ðŸŽ² Foundry VTT Macros

A collection of custom JavaScript macros for [Foundry Virtual Tabletop (VTT)](https://foundryvtt.com/).  
These macros are designed to do all kinds of wacky interesting things like play a sound, animation, or automate tasks.
Some macros may rely on certain modules being present.
